# linux-config-

I'm using a Linux Mint installation with i3-gaps window manager and rofi application launcher.
Here you can find the config files that i store in tile/.config/

### Functionalities:
- multiple, smart workspaces, where each app knows where to spawn
- automatic tiling
- beautiful gaps between windows
- useful bar
- incredibly intuitive shortcuts
- nice,uniform dracula-like theming

### Some screenshots follow:

This setup led to an increase in coding productivity and allowed me to understand a bit better how linux can be customized

### TODO:
- improve theme coordination
- improve terminal functionality and aspect maybe passing to zsh
